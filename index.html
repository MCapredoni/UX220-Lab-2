            Currently, I am going through one of my courses textbooks, regarding how big companies operate projects, and
            what it takes to do so successfully.

            The textbook offers a lot of insights revolving around strategy, risk management, payback analysis and also
            provides some real life examples. Personally, I find a lot of this side of the business really interesting,
            and
            im happy that the course textbook is so insightful.
